# Learning Ruby
Resources for beginners learning ruby. Just a WIP for now!

## Exercises
Under the `/exercises` directory there are challenges separated by folder.
Each folder contains a series of tests which you can run as a guide to developing your own solution.

You can clone this repository and add your own solutions to each exercise folder. Test your code by running the test suite alongside your solution. i.e. `ruby hello_world_test.rb`

Comment out each successive `skip` to run the next test once your code passes the tests you've already run!
